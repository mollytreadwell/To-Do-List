# Final Style Touches

This project highlights some classic structural elements required to form a proper list including components of React such as the utilization of setValue and useState. These helpful methods allow the creator to automatically update their list as new values are generated and/or deleted. 

## What Else Is Going On Here?

In addition to the use of React, the project incorportates some CSS styling to make the list items more interesting and eye catching. Much more styling can easily be incorportated using similar properties such as color, padding and spacial alterations.
